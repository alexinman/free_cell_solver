module StateDuplicator
  # Hi Candice, this is the second module you'll need to implement.
  # All functionality is described in the tests in state_duplicator_test.rb.
  # You'll need to implement the following method:
  # - dup(state)
  # And you can validate your implementation by running `rake`.
  # Good luck!
end
