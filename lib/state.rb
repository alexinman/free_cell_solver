class State
  # Hi Candice, this is the fifth class you'll need to implement.
  # All functionality is described in the tests in cascade_test.rb.
  # You'll need to implement the following methods:
  # - initialize(cells, foundations, cascades)
  # - self.build(deck)
  # - cells
  # - foundations
  # - cascades
  # - ==(other)
  # - eql?(other)
  # - hash
  # And you can validate your implementation by running `rake`.
  # Good luck!
end
