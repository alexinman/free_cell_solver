module StateFormatter
  # Hi Candice, this is the first module you'll need to implement.
  # A module is a collection of methods that can be included in a class.
  # In this case, we won't be including it in a class, but we'll still
  # be able to call the methods from the module.
  # All functionality is described in the tests in state_formatter_test.rb.
  # You'll need to implement the following method:
  # - self.format(state)
  # And you can validate your implementation by running `rake`.
  # Good luck!
end
