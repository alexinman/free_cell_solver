  # Hi Candice, this is the third class you'll need to implement.
  # All functionality is described in the tests in foundation_test.rb.
  # You'll need to implement the following methods:
  # - add?(cards)
  # - remove?(number)
  # And you can validate your implementation by running `rake`.
  # Good luck!
end
